bugs
====

- when following a user, if a new user_viewing event comes while displaying all photos, something weird will happen
- sometimes when hitting enter in the comment box, a form submission will happen, particularly on chrome
- comments that were posted by offline users are not processed properly
- don't let user refresh without a warning
- improve upload UI, right now too easy to drag a photo into the browser window

- action sidebar:
 - by default: opacity 0
 - on mouse move: set opacity to 1.0
   - add timer to reset opacity back to 0
   - timer is cancelled on new mousemove
 - when mouse enters action-sidebar, clear timer
   - re-enable timer when mouse leaves action-sidebar
 - when photo is selected, set opacity to 0.0 and remove timers
