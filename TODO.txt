
improvements
============

- show explanation for first-time users
 - URL of conference
 - improve indication of how to load photos
 - follow / look here buttons
- improve loading speed of high res photo. This need to be smart otherwise quick browsing will generate 
huge amounts of http requests. maybe slow down the requests if user is browsing quickly.
- make photo carousel follow currently viewed photo, and highlight currently shown
- provide option to show all photos for rapid jumping, maybe left of "full screen"
- show photo number briefly
