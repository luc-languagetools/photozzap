bugs
====

- improve all image display and selection
- when following a user, if a new user_viewing event comes while displaying all photos, something weird will happen
- sometimes when hitting enter in the comment box, a form submission will happen, particularly on chrome
- comments that were posted by offline users are not processed properly
- don't let user refresh without a warning
- improve upload UI, right now too easy to drag a photo into the browser window
